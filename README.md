# Navy SEALs Extended
Navy SEALs is a partial conversion for Quake developed by Minh Le (Gooseman), SkullHunter, William. This modification would be one of the precursors to one of the most popular competitive shooters of all time, Counter-Strike.

# What is the goal of this project?
This modification serves as an unofficial patch. Which aims to add in QoL improvements and probably more additions. This also serves as a starting point for me to learn more about QuakeC.

# Known issues
- Creating a listen server will crash FTEQW (Does not crash QUAKE.EXE v1.08 however)
- Manual reloading is broken (right-handed weapons)
- The laser sight is hardcoded for left-handed weapons.

# Credits
* Minh Le for creating this modification
* id Software for making Quake
* [DOSBox Deathmatch Club](http://www.dosboxdmclub.com/) Community for playtesting
* erysdren for Implementing a map cycle (Deathmatch)
