# Navy SEALs Extended
Navy SEALs is a partial conversion for Quake developed by Minh Le (Gooseman), SkullHunter, William. This modification would be one of the precursors to one of the most popular competitive shooters of all time, Counter-Strike.

# What is the goal of this project?
This serves as a unofficial patch, aiming to add in some quality of life features. This also serves as a starting point for me to learn more about QuakeC.

# To-do
[ ] Implement support for right-handed and centered weapon views. (Original was only left-handed)
[ ] Automatic reloading for weapons
[ ] Proper support for Deathmatch 3 rules
[ ] Map cycle via maplist.txt

# Credits
* Minh Le for creating this modification
* id Software for making Quake
* DOSBox Deathmatch Club Community for playtesting
