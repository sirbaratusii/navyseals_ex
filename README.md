# Navy SEALs Extended
Navy SEALs is a partial conversion for Quake developed by Minh Le (Gooseman), SkullHunter, William. This modification would be one of the precursors to one of the most popular competitive shooters of all time, Counter-Strike.

# What is the goal of this project?
This modification serves as an unofficial patch. Which aims to add in QoL improvements and probably more additions. This also serves as a starting point for me to learn more about QuakeC.

# To-do
- [ ] Modify the weapon view models to have non-fullbright arms.
- [ ] Rewrite the reloading functionality to be more simpler?
- [ ] Implement support for centered weapon views. (Original was only left-handed, right handed was added)
- [ ] Proper support for Deathmatch 3 rules
- [ ] Randomize weapon spawns (PSG-1, MP5 had additional pickups, etc)
- [ ] Chasecam feature

# Known issues
- Creating a listen server will crash FTEQW (Does not crash QUAKE.EXE v1.08 however)
- Manual reloading is broken (right-handed weapons)
- The laser sight is hardcoded for left-handed weapons.
